Introduction

Dollar Bank Customer Churn Analysis using SQL + Python + Tableau: An end-to-end project that involved exploratory analysis with SQL, a deep-dive EDA using Python, and building an interactive dashboard with Tableau to present meaningful business insights for the bank.

Dollar Bank was concerned that more and more customers were leaving its credit card services. They asked for a seasoned Data Analyst to analyze the problem for them in order to understand the main reasons for customers leaving the services. They also needed me to come up with recommendations for how the bank can mitigate further customer churns. Eventually, the bank wanted to proactively implement these recommendations in order to keep their customers happy.
